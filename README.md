### Python

#### Project 1: Telecom Churn Analysis
- **Code:** [Python-Project](https://github.com/DanyCSantana/Python-Project/blob/main/UCDPA_DANYELLASANTANA(1).ipynb)
- **Goal:** Analyze customer churn in the telecom industry to provide insights for improving customer retention strategies.
- **Description:** This project focuses on analyzing customer churn using Python, with a dataset obtained from Kaggle. The dataset includes customer demographics, call usage patterns, and service interactions. Using Python libraries such as pandas and matplotlib, the project explores churn rates, regional variations, and the impact of customer service calls on churn. Key steps include data preprocessing, merging datasets, and creating new features. The goal is to provide actionable insights to telecom companies to enhance customer retention and service quality.
- **Skills:**
- Data Manipulation; Data Visualization; Statistical Analysis; Data Preprocessing
- **Technology:**
- Python; Pandas; Matplotlib; Seaborn
- **Results:** The total churn rate for the telecom company is 14.5%, with significant regional variations.
The South region has the highest churn count, but the Northeast has the highest churn percentage at 17%.
Analysis revealed that 81% of churned customers and 78% of non-churned customers contacted customer service at least once.
Notable churn was found in customers with account lengths of 6 to 10 years.
The project provided insights into regional churn patterns and customer service impact, helping to identify areas for targeted retention strategies.
