## üöÄ Portfolio Projects

### Python

#### Python Tool for Sourcing Images Across 800+ Folders

- **Code:** [`ImageManagementScript.py`](https://github.com/DanyCSantana/Image-Sourcing-Automation)  
- **Goal**: Automate the retrieval and organization of inflight entertainment posters and stills using a list of titles from an Excel tracker.
- **Description**: This Python script searches over 300 distributor folders (30,000+ images) to find only the images listed in an Excel file. It applies smart string matching, copies matched files to structured folders, updates the tracker, and creates reports for missing assets‚Äîincluding an email-ready draft for distributors.
- **Skills**: File automation, Excel integration, regex, reporting  
- **Tech**: Python, pandas, openpyxl, pathlib, tqdm
- **Results**: Reduced manual work by over 90%, cutting image sourcing time from hours to under 10 minutes.

### Image Automation Suite for Entertainment Media Images

- **Code:** [`image_automation_suite`](https://github.com/DanyCSantana/image_automation_suite)  
- **Goal:** Automate resizing, cropping, and organizing large batches of inflight entertainment images (posters and stills) into multiple target dimensions with standardized naming and folder structure.  
- **Description:**  
  This Python-based suite dramatically reduces manual effort required to prepare images for inflight entertainment systems. Manually resizing and cropping 200 images into 4 different sizes can take over 10 hours in tools like Photoshop. This suite accomplishes it in about 10-15 minutes while ensuring consistent quality and file organization.  
  It supports center and top cropping options, optimized JPEG output, and interactive terminal usage.  
- **Skills:** Image processing, batch automation, file management, CLI interface  
- **Tech:** Python, Pillow, tqdm  
- **Results:** Time saved by over 90%, improved consistency, and automation of repetitive tasks enabling focus on higher-level work.

### Bulk Dropbox Downloader and Image Sourcing with OCR Sorting

- **Code:** [`dropbox_image_import.py`](https://github.com/DanyCSantana/Automate-Dropbox-downloader)  
- **Goal:** Automate the bulk download, extraction, and processing of movie images from multiple Dropbox links listed in Excel. The script downloads ZIP files, extracts contents, uses OCR to identify posters based on multilingual text detection, and organizes images into clean, structured folders by movie title, eliminating manual downloads and sorting.  
- **Description:** Handles the end-to-end pipeline for importing inflight entertainment images delivered via Dropbox. Processes include batch downloading, ZIP extraction, OCR-based classification, smart renaming based on Excel metadata, duplicate removal, and Excel tracker updates.  
- **Skills:** Python scripting, HTTP requests, ZIP file handling, OCR (`pytesseract`), image processing (`Pillow`), Excel automation, file renaming and organization.  
- **Tech:** Python, requests, zipfile, Pillow, pytesseract, pandas, OS.  
- **Results:** Reduced manual workload for image sorting and naming by over **80%**, established a scalable and reusable workflow for processing image deliveries from multiple distributors, enhanced accuracy in image classification through OCR and consistent business logic.


#### Telecom Churn Analysis
- **Code:** [Churn-Project-Coursera.py](https://github.com/DanyCSantana/Churn-Project-Coursera)
- **Goal:** Analyze customer churn in the telecom industry to provide insights for improving customer retention strategies.
- **Description:** This project focuses on analyzing customer churn using Python, with a dataset obtained from Kaggle. The dataset includes customer demographics, call usage patterns, and service interactions. Using Python libraries such as pandas and matplotlib, the project explores churn rates, regional variations, and the impact of customer service calls on churn. Key steps include data preprocessing, merging datasets, and creating new features. The goal is to provide actionable insights to telecom companies to enhance customer retention and service quality.
- **Skills:**
  - Data Manipulation; Data Visualization; Statistical Analysis; Data Preprocessing
- **Technology:**
  - Python; Pandas; Matplotlib; Seaborn
- **Results:** The total churn rate for the telecom company is 14.5%, with significant regional variations.
  The South region has the highest churn count, but the Northeast has the highest churn percentage at 17%.
  Analysis revealed that 81% of churned customers and 78% of non-churned customers contacted customer service at least once.
  Notable churn was found in customers with account lengths of 6 to 10 years.
  The project provided insights into regional churn patterns and customer service impact, helping to identify areas for targeted retention strategies.
