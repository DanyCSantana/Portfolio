# Project: Customer Retention Analysis for TV Services

## Overview
During my tenure at a telecom company in Brazil, I undertook a comprehensive analysis aimed at enhancing customer retention strategies for TV services. This project leveraged extensive data from internal databases to uncover insights into customer behaviors and churn indicators.

## Objective
The primary goal of this analysis was to identify factors influencing customer retention and churn, enabling the company to proactively address customer attrition and optimize service offerings.

## Data Utilized
I utilized data sourced from three main datasets:

- PLNTA: Dataset containing historical customer data related to TV service retention.
- RET: Dataset capturing customer withdrawal information.
- GROSS_TV: Comprehensive dataset encompassing various customer attributes and service details.

## Methods and Techniques
To achieve the project goals, I employed a combination of SAS programming techniques:
Macro Development: Developed a versatile SAS macro (%MACRO ANOMES_RET) to efficiently process monthly data spanning multiple years.
Data Preparation: Utilized SAS data steps for data cleaning, merging (MERGE), and filtering (WHERE).
SQL Queries: Implemented PROC SQL for complex data manipulations, including joins (LEFT JOIN) and aggregation (GROUP BY).
Insights and Impact
Through rigorous analysis and interpretation of the data, I uncovered crucial insights:

Identification of key churn indicators (INDICADOR_CHURN) and their correlation with customer demographics and service usage.
Calculation of customer retention aging (AGING_RETIRADA) and segmentation into retention age brackets (FAIXA_AGING_RET).
Business Value
This analysis provided actionable insights that could potentially:

Inform targeted marketing strategies to retain at-risk customers.
Optimize service plans and customer support initiatives based on behavioral patterns and retention trends.
Tools Used
I utilized SAS programming language and tools such as SAS Enterprise Guide to execute data manipulation tasks efficiently and generate insightful visualizations.

## Challenges and Solutions
Throughout the project, I encountered challenges such as managing large datasets and ensuring data consistency. By leveraging SASâ€™s robust capabilities and applying meticulous data validation processes, I successfully overcame these challenges to deliver accurate and actionable insights.

## Conclusion
This project not only enhanced my proficiency in data analysis and SAS programming but also demonstrated my ability to contribute strategically to business objectives. The insights gained have the potential to significantly impact customer retention efforts within the telecom sector, underscoring the value of data-driven decision-making in driving business success.
