- **Results:** The total churn rate for the telecom company is 14.5%, with significant regional variations.
The South region has the highest churn count, but the Northeast has the highest churn percentage at 17%.
Analysis revealed that 81% of churned customers and 78% of non-churned customers contacted customer service at least once.
Notable churn was found in customers with account lengths of 6 to 10 years.
The project provided insights into regional churn patterns and customer service impact, helping to identify areas for targeted retention strategies.
