### Python

#### Python Tool for Sourcing Images Across 800+ Folders

- **Code:** [`ImageManagementScript.py`](https://github.com/DanyCSantana/Python-Project/blob/main/ImageManagementScript.py)  
- **Goal:** Manage a large database of nearly **30,000 images** across **800+ distributor folders** using Python to automate the search, classification, and organization of posters and stills, reducing manual work by over **90%**.  
- **Description:** Recursively searches through 300+ distributor folders to locate images matching movie titles from an Excel sheet, employs smart string matching to accurately identify relevant images, copies them to a structured output directory, updates the Excel tracker with results, and generates detailed missing-image reports with ready-to-send email drafts.  
- **Skills:** Python scripting, file system automation, Excel integration (`pandas`, `openpyxl`), logging, regex, progress bars (`tqdm`).  
- **Tech:** Python 3.x, pandas, openpyxl, pathlib, tqdm, logging.  
- **Results:** Automated processing of ~30,000 images across 800+ folders, reduced image retrieval and organization time from several hours to under 10 minutes, with full traceability and comprehensive reporting.
**Code:** `ImageManagementScript.py`  

**Goal:**  Efficiently source poster and still images requested by airlines by searching through a large image database of nearly 30,000 files spread across 800+ distributor folders using Python automation, reducing manual workload by over 90%.
**Description:**  Recursively searches 300+ distributor folders to find images matching movie titles from an Excel sheet. Uses smart string matching, copies images to a structured output directory, updates the Excel tracker, and generates detailed missing-image reports with ready-to-send email drafts.
**Skills:**  Python scripting, file system automation, Excel integration (`pandas`, `openpyxl`), logging, regex, progress bars (`tqdm`).
**Tech:**  Python 3.x, pandas, openpyxl, pathlib, tqdm, logging.
**Results:**  Streamlined the sourcing and organization of nearly 30,000 images across 800+ folders, reducing manual search time by over 90% from hours to under 10 minutes with full traceability and reporting.

### Bulk Dropbox Downloader and Image Sourcing with OCR Sorting

- **Code:** [`dropbox_image_import.py`](https://github.com/DanyCSantana/Python-Project/blob/main/dropbox_image_import.py)  
- **Goal:** Automate the bulk download, extraction, and processing of movie images from multiple Dropbox links listed in Excel. The script downloads ZIP files, extracts contents, uses OCR to identify posters based on multilingual text detection, and organizes images into clean, structured folders by movie title, eliminating manual downloads and sorting.  
- **Description:** Handles the end-to-end pipeline for importing inflight entertainment images delivered via Dropbox. Processes include batch downloading, ZIP extraction, OCR-based classification, smart renaming based on Excel metadata, duplicate removal, and Excel tracker updates.  
- **Skills:** Python scripting, HTTP requests, ZIP file handling, OCR (`pytesseract`), image processing (`Pillow`), Excel automation, file renaming and organization.  
- **Tech:** Python, requests, zipfile, Pillow, pytesseract, pandas, OS.  
- **Results:** Reduced manual workload for image sorting and naming by over **80%**, established a scalable and reusable workflow for processing image deliveries from multiple distributors, enhanced accuracy in image classification through OCR and consistent business logic.


#### Telecom Churn Analysis
- **Code:** [Python-Project](https://github.com/DanyCSantana/Python-Project/blob/main/UCDPA_DANYELLASANTANA(1).ipynb)
- **Goal:** Analyze customer churn in the telecom industry to provide insights for improving customer retention strategies.
- **Description:** This project focuses on analyzing customer churn using Python, with a dataset obtained from Kaggle. The dataset includes customer demographics, call usage patterns, and service interactions. Using Python libraries such as pandas and matplotlib, the project explores churn rates, regional variations, and the impact of customer service calls on churn. Key steps include data preprocessing, merging datasets, and creating new features. The goal is to provide actionable insights to telecom companies to enhance customer retention and service quality.
- **Skills:**
  - Data Manipulation; Data Visualization; Statistical Analysis; Data Preprocessing
- **Technology:**
  - Python; Pandas; Matplotlib; Seaborn
- **Results:** The total churn rate for the telecom company is 14.5%, with significant regional variations.
  The South region has the highest churn count, but the Northeast has the highest churn percentage at 17%.
  Analysis revealed that 81% of churned customers and 78% of non-churned customers contacted customer service at least once.
  Notable churn was found in customers with account lengths of 6 to 10 years.
  The project provided insights into regional churn patterns and customer service impact, helping to identify areas for targeted retention strategies.



### SQL

#### Project 3: Budget Estimation for Marketing Campaigns
- **Code:** [Budget_Estimation.sql](https://github.com/DanyCSantana/SQL-Projects/blob/main/25%20-%20Modelo_Or%C3%A7amento_2018_Vworking_Periodo_incompleto.sas)
- **Goal:** To create an accurate budget estimate for upcoming marketing campaigns based on historical data and projected needs.
- **Description:** This project involved analyzing historical spending data and projected requirements to develop a comprehensive budget for marketing campaigns. Using SQL queries, I aggregated and analyzed data from various sources to determine cost distribution and forecast future expenses. The project included data cleaning, cost analysis, and generating budget reports to guide financial planning. The final output was a detailed budget proposal, providing insights into cost allocation and potential savings.
- **Skills:**
  - Data Analysis; Financial Forecasting; Data Cleaning; Report Generation
- **Technology:**
  - SQL; SAS; Excel
- **Results:** Developed a detailed and accurate budget estimate for marketing campaigns, leading to improved financial planning and resource allocation. The proposal helped in optimizing the marketing budget, aligning it better with strategic goals, and resulted in a 15% reduction in unnecessary expenditures.
